## üîç Example

As an example, take following query:

```
query {
  getBoards {
    id name memberships {
      id user {
        email
      }
    }
    lists {
      items {
        id name list {
          id name
          board {
            id name
            memberships {
              id user {
                id email
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The helper will return the following relation string:

```
[
  "memberships",
  "memberships.user",
  "lists",
  "lists.items",
  "lists.items.list",
  "lists.items.list.board",
  "lists.items.list.board.memberships",
  "lists.items.list.board.memberships.user"
]
```
